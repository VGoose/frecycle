          We are defined by our belief that the environmentally responsible lifestyle 
          must be lived, and it is attractive.
          <br /><br />
          Our goal is to empower consumers to make environmentally-conscious choices 
          by providing quality, and responsibly-made products.  Through these small 
          choices, we hope to create a movement that will redefine the everyday personâ€™s 
          way of living into one that is more thoughtful, and sustainable.
